# Personal RAG: Your Local, Secure, and Intelligent Data Assistant

## Motivation

In today's digital age, we're constantly generating and accumulating personal data across various platforms and formats - from text documents and emails to photos, videos, and audio recordings. However, accessing and making sense of this scattered information remains a significant challenge. Traditional search methods are often limited to specific file types or platforms, making it difficult to find relevant information across different data modalities.

This project addresses these challenges by creating a personal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- Keeps your data completely local and secure
- Understands and processes multiple types of data (text, images, videos, audio)
- Provides intelligent, context-aware responses to your queries
- Gives you full control over your data

## Key Features

### 1. Local-First Architecture
- All data processing and storage happens locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers except for LLM API calls
- Your sensitive information remains under your control
- Vector database for efficient semantic search across all data types

### 2. Multi-Modal Understanding
- **Text Processing**: Handles documents, emails, and web content
- **Image Analysis**: Extracts and understands visual content
- **Video Processing**: Analyzes video frames and audio
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts speech to text for searchability
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Enables queries across different data types

### 3. Intelligent Data Management
- **Selective Data Loading**: Choose which data types to include in the vector database
- **Smart Chunking**: Breaks down large documents into meaningful segments
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimizes vector database usage to prevent data congestion
- **Customizable Processing**: Configure how different data types are processed and stored

### 4. Privacy-Focused Design
- No data is stored in the cloud
- LLM API calls only include relevant data chunks
- Full control over data access and processing
- Transparent data handling process

## Use Cases

1. **Personal Knowledge Management**
   - Search across all your personal documents and media
   - Find specific information in photos or videos
   - Retrieve relevant audio recordings

2. **Research and Learning**
   - Organize and search through study materials
   - Find specific topics in lecture recordings
   - Cross-reference information across different media types

3. **Professional Use**
   - Search through work documents and presentations
   - Find specific moments in meeting recordings
   - Retrieve relevant information from project files

4. **Personal Archives**
   - Search through family photos and videos
   - Find specific memories in audio recordings
   - Organize and retrieve personal documents

## Technical Architecture

### Data Ingestion
- Supports multiple data sources (local files, OneNote, etc.)
- Intelligent content extraction and processing
- Configurable data type handling

### Vector Storage
- Local vector database for semantic search
- Efficient storage of embeddings
- Optimized retrieval performance

### Query Processing
- Semantic search across all data types
- Context-aware response generation
- LLM integration for intelligent responses

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Run the data ingestion process
5. Start querying your personal data

## Future Enhancements

- Additional data source integrations
- Enhanced multi-modal understanding
- Improved query processing
- Advanced data management features
- Custom LLM model support
